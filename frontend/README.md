our job is to build a locally hosted website (preferably using React for the frontend and Node.js for the backend) that shows a list of Public Works vehicles in a sample City fleet. Our evaluation of this site will be based on the degree to which it is fast and error free; provides a clean, intuitive, professional, and modern UI / UX; and demonstrates your creativity in data visualization/sorting features.

    The website should include at least five vehicles, and show picture, asset ID, body type, and maintenance status. I've attached a CSV with sample data that you can use.

    The website should allow filtering vehicles based on the body type (pickup, SUV, or sedan) and maintenance status (undergoing maintenance, in use, upcoming maintenance).

    [Bonus Points] There should be vehicle-specific maintenance tasks triggered automatically once every 5 months that show as a "pop up" on the page.
